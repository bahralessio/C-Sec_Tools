# C-Sec_Tools
Hi! This is my first public repo, I made it so that everyone interested can download this set of tools.
My goal here is to include in this set all the tools that I will be working on during a Systems Vulnerabilities
course that I am currently following at my university.
The scripts in here will be written in bash and python (and maybe more in the future) and are aimed at 
building automated, personalized tools for pen-testing.
I will add another file with the requirements specifications so that everyone can see what is needed and
install any missing package.
