# C-Sec_Tools
Hi! This is my first public repo, and it is related to Cyber Security (for studying purpuses).
I am currently following a Systems Vulnerabilities course at my university, and I am planning to make a set
of tools that are useful for practicing and, of course, for the exam.
The scripts in here will be written in bash or python (and maybe more in the future) and are aimed at 
building automated, personalized tools for pen-testing.
I will add another file with the requirements specifications so that everyone can see what is needed and
install any missing packages.
